# NYC_schools_perceptions_analysis
The analysis seeks to understand how the perceptions of schools affect performance and demographics and vice versa

The csv file has some data about some NYC schools academics and demographics. 
The New York City department of education data was originally obtained with the aim of understanding how NYC high schools’ demographics affect student performance.
This analysis incorporates survey data containing responses for the year 2011 designed to gauge parent, student, and teacher perceptions of the quality of New York City schools. 

It seeks to answer the following questions:
•	Do student, teacher, and parent perceptions of NYC school quality appear to be related to demographic and academic success metrics?
•	Do students, teachers, and parents have similar perceptions of NYC school quality?

Survey Data Dictionary.xls, contains metadata that will be useful as you decide how to clean and prepare the survey data for analysis.
masterfile11_gened_final.xlsx and masterfile11_gened_final.txt, contain survey data for "general education" schools — those that do not specifically serve populations with special needs.
masterfile11_d75_final.xlsx and masterfile11_d75_final.txt contain survey data for District 75 schools, which provide exceptional education support for children with special needs such as learning or physical disabilities.
The data is the same in both formats. It is presented in formats that Microsoft Excel (the .xlxs files) can open and as unformatted text (the .txt files). 

Survey questions assess the following metrics:
i.	Safety and Respect
ii.	Communication
iii.	Engagement
iv.	Academic Expectations

The following groups responded to the survey:
a)	Parents
b)	Teachers
c)	Students
d)	Total (The average of parent, teacher, and student scores)

The findings from the analysis include:
- Scores for teachers were more spread out than those for students and parents
- The larger & smaller scores are equally spread out for all metrics across all groups except safety & respect(among parents) and academic expectations (among students)
- For academic expectations(among students), those that are smaller than medium value are close together.
- For safety & respect(among parents), those that are higher than medium value are closer together.
